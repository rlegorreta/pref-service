Microservice that acts as the graph repository for user preferences.

The `pref-service` depends that the graph of users (ie., `iam-ui` and `iam-service` microservices) al ready exists 
and the user has been created. The `pref-service` add extra information in the graph that is maintenaided for 
any microservice that user user preference (e.g., `cartera-ui`micro service).

note: this microservice is one of the oldest one, so little graphql is used, but Spring Data


## Introduction

The `pref-service` micro service is in charge to do all operations to persist the user preferences. Is has 
REST GET, POST and DELETE  REST API in order to handle user preferences for:

- Grid preferences: hide columns, sort and order columns.

- UDFs (user defined functions) for Grids and Forms.

- Other preferences can be added in a future version (e.g., colors, application specifics, etc.)

## Dependency with IAM database

This micro service need that the iam database is already created and populated with users

### IAMDB ports

By default `iamDB` is configured to use the 7687 port to be accessed externally.

Other ports are port 7474, 7473 for :bolt driver

## Compilation

When this microservice is compiled it sends the following warning:

```
The entity XXXXXXX is using a Long value for storing internally generated Neo4j ids. The Neo4j internal Long Ids are deprecated, please consider using an external ID generator.
```

As for documentation in SDN Neo4j it still utilizes Long es generated value and in :

```
https://community.neo4j.com/t5/drivers-stacks/list-of-relationshipproperties/m-p/61214
```

Is says Please ignore this warning for now because we are still not sure if we will just stick with the
old `id` format and dismiss this warning in the GA version.

This maybe change for Neo4j 5 and SDN 7

### Design notes

- All repositories extends from Neo4j repository.

- Three controllers are developed: one for Administrators, one for Users and one for Statistics.


### Events generated

All events generated to `kafka` came with a field "notificaFacultad" where indicates that notification must be sent 
to all user with this permit.

This is the event generated by this micro.servico to the Even-logger

- Event name: ALTA_PREFERENCIA
  Action: new a permit.
  Data: FacultadDTO

### Events listener

No event listener is used.

  
## Running on Docker Desktop

### Create the image manually

```
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

### Publish the image to GitHub manually

```
./gradlew bootBuildImage \
   --imageName ghcr.io/rlegorreta/pref-service \
   --publishImage \
   -PregistryUrl=ghcr.io \
   -PregistryUsername=rlegorreta \
   -PregistryToken=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
```

### Publish the image to GitHub from the IntelliJ

To publish the image to GitHub from the IDE IntelliJ a file inside the directory `.github/workflows/commit-stage.yml`
was created.

To validate the manifest file for kubernetes run the following command:

```
kubeval --strict -d k8s
```

This file compiles de project, test it (for this project is disabled for some bug), test vulnerabilities running
skype, commits the code, sends a report of vulnerabilities, creates the image and lastly push the container image.

For detail information see `.github/workflows/commit-stage.yml` file.


### Run the image inside the Docker desktop

```
docker run \
    --net ailegorretaNet \
    -p 8183:8183 \
    -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local \
    pref-service
```

Or a better method use the `docker-compose` tool. Go to the directory `ailegorreta-deployment/docker-platform` and run
the command:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Run inside Kubernetes

### Manually

If we do not use the `Tilt`tool nd want to do it manually, first we need to create the image:

Fist step:

```
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

Second step:

Then we have to load the image inside the minikube executing the command:

```
image load ailegorreta/pref-service --profile ailegorreta 
```

To verify that the image has been loaded we can execute the command that lists all minikube images:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath="{..image}" | tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' | sort | uniq -c\n
```

Third step:

Then execute the deployment defined in the file `k8s/deployment.yml` with the command:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yml
```

And after the deployment can be deleted executing:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yml
```

Fourth step:

For service discovery we need to create a service applying with the file: `k8s/service.yml` executing the command:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yml
```

And after the process we can delete the service executing:

```
kubectl deltete -f k8s/service.yml
```

Fifth step:

If we want to use the project outside kubernetes we have to forward the port as follows:

```
kubectl port-forward service/config-service 8183:80
```

Appendix:

If we want to see the logs for this `pod` we can execute the following command:

```
kubectl logs deployment/pref-service
```

### Using Tilt tool

To avoid all these boilerplate steps is much better and faster to use the `Tilt` tool as follows: first create see the
file located in the root directory of the proyect called `TiltFile`. This file has the content:

```
# Tilt file for pref-service
# Build
custom_build(
    # Name of the container image
    ref = 'pref-service',
    # Command to build the container image
    command = './gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName $EXPECTED_REF',
    # Files to watch that trigger a new build
    deps = ['build.gradle', 'src']
)

# Deploy
k8s_yaml(['k8s/deployment.yml', 'k8s/service.yml'])

# Manage
k8s_resource('config-service', port_forwards=['8183'])
```

To execute all five steps manually we just need to execute the command:

```
tilt up
```

In order to see the log of the deployment process please visit the following URL:

```
http://localhost:10350
```

Or execute outside Tilt the command:

```
kubectl logs deployment/pref-service
```

In order to undeploy everything just execute the command:

```
tilt down
```

To run inside a docker desktop the microservice need to use http://pref-service:8183 to 8083 path
